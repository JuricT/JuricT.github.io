# ToDoList
The project to create a page with a list of tasks [(ToDoList)](http://jurict.github.io/GoFrontend/Tech%20Skills/JS%2023-24/build/index.html), which aims to learn how to apply the principles of `MVC` when writing code to learn how to use the module loader `Require.js` to address dependencies between modules and not clogging the global scope.

Project description
Build the project is carried out with the help of `Gulp`. To create an HTML markup used HTML template `Jade`, to style preprocessor `SASS`. Scripts are written in ES6 with subsequent conversion to `ES5` using `Babel`. Apply the MVC pattern in the development of the logic of the application. JavaScript files are loaded using the `Require.js`. To optimize the number of queries to the server used SVG sprites.
